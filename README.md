## Known issues

- In case you have an issue with running the boiler plate in development mode, particularly in sass then try to run `npm rebuld node-sass`.
- When adding a `styleName` in an `index.jsx` file (and save file) and then adding that `styleName` to the `style.scss` file (also save file), that css will not work until you go back to the `index.jsx` file and save again. *we should look for a fix for this*
